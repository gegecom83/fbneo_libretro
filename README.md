# FinalBurn Neo [Libretro] Game Launcher

A PyQt5-based GUI launcher for FinalBurn Neo (Libretro core), supporting many retro systems, ROM metadata, and images.

## Features

- **Multi-system support:** Manage and launch ROMs for Arcade, NES, SNES, Sega, Neo-Geo, MSX, ZX Spectrum, and many more.
- **Automatic ROM metadata:** Auto-generate ROM title lists with year and manufacturer info via XML/DAT files.
- **Joystick navigation:** Full joystick/gamepad navigation and controls, including rapid scrolling and system switching.
- **Configurable:** All settings (paths, controls, XML files) are easily editable in the GUI.
- **Fast search & filtering:** Find ROMs quickly by title, year, or manufacturer.
- **Support for Title and Preview Images with automatic prefixing**
- **Cross-platform:** Works on Windows, Linux, and macOS (requires Python 3, PyQt5, and pygame).

## Image Support

For each ROM, the launcher can display **title and preview images**.  
To work, place your images in the designated folders and use the correct filename prefix as specified below.

### Image Naming Convention

- Images must be PNG files.
- The filename format is:  
  `<prefix><rombasename>.png`
- Example: For the NES ROM `mariobros.zip`, the image file would be `nes_mariobros.png`.

## Installation

1. **Clone/download** this repository.
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install PyQt5 pygame
   ```
3. Make sure you have [RetroArch](https://www.retroarch.com/) and the FinalBurn Neo core (`fbneo_libretro`).
4. Place your ROMs in the appropriate folders for each system.

## Usage

Run the script:
```bash
python fbneo_libretro.py
```

- Set up paths to RetroArch, the FBNeo core, and your ROM folders via the **Settings** dialog.
- Optionally, add XML/DAT files for richer ROM metadata.
- Browse, search, and filter your ROMs by system, title, year, or manufacturer.
- Double-click or press your joystick "select" button to launch a game instantly.

## Configuration

All settings are stored in `config.json` (auto-generated).  
You can configure:

- Set the directories for ROMs, Title Images, and Preview Images for each system in the **Settings** dialog.
- Paths to RetroArch and FBNeo core (.dll/.so/.dylib)
- ROM folders per system
- XML/DAT metadata files per system (optional)
- Joystick button mappings and scrolling behavior
- If no image is available, the launcher will display `"image not available"` in place of the image.

The "Auto-create ROM Titles" button is a utility to generate rom_titles_xxxx.txt files, which provide a convenient way to store and display ROM metadata (titles, years, manufacturers) for a system, especially when XML/DAT files are absent or incomplete. However, the application can still display ROMs correctly without these files because it can fall back to XML/DAT metadata or, for specific systems like SNK Neo-Geo CD, use the ROM filenames as titles. The button is particularly useful for:

    Systems without XML/DAT files.
    Ensuring consistent title display across all ROMs.
    Creating a portable, simplified metadata file that can be manually edited if needed.

If the rom_titles_xxxx.txt file is missing, the application relies on the XML/DAT file for metadata. For ROMs not found in the XML/DAT file, it uses the ROM's base filename as the title (for SNK Neo-Geo CD) or skips the ROM (for other systems).
